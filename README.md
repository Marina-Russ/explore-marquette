### Introduction
 
 I created this website to practice making a flexible, mobile-first site. I picked Marquette, MI because that is where I attended university. It was very nostalgic to make a website for a city that I truly loved living in. I also had a lot of fun color-coordinating the different subpages to match the colorful navigation bar.
